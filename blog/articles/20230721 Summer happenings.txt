Hey yall, just puttin up a blog post to say my summer is going well.
I've been playing a toooon of Payday 2 and i'm closing in on infamy level 25,
but outside of that not much is going on with me. I've been kinda stuck in
a rut coding-wise, because I really wanna do something but I just can't figure
out what to do, since I really wanna make a chat app but I don't have a server
to run it off of, and I want to make mods for Minecraft or Factorio but I've
got no idea how to go about it. Anyways, I'll be disappearing for the next month

have a great day or else <3
