                i'm Thorne and i use she/they pronouns, though honestly as long as it's not masculine you can refer to me with whatever your heart desires. i also go by a couple other names because who doesn't love having multiple first names, and you can find them plus a rough list of what terms i'm comfortable with <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@dragonthorne">here.</a> i have far too much time on my hands thanks to my awful sleep schedule, and i use it for playing things like Minecraft, Payday 2, Ultrakill, and Deep Rock Galactic, though i do have an obscene number of hours on 4D Minesweeper. i also have a habit of trying to learn languages from video games, such as Payday 2's kataru language, or the dragon language from Skyrim, a game i have never played.
